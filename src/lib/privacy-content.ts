        content: `
            <h3>2.1 Nigerian Constitutional Provisions</h3>
            <p>WebIntel acknowledges and respects the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed under Section 37 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), which provides that the privacy of citizens, their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations, and telegraphic communications is hereby guaranteed and protected. This constitutional guarantee extends to the digital domain and encompasses the right of individuals to control their personal information and to be protected against unauthorized intrusion into their private affairs.</p>
            <p>The Platform has been designed and is operated in a manner that upholds and gives effect to this constitutional guarantee. Our privacy-first architecture, which stores user data locally on user devices rather than on centralized servers, represents a technical implementation of the constitutional commitment to privacy protection. We recognize that the right to privacy is not absolute and may be subject to limitations necessary in a democratic society for purposes such as public safety, prevention of crime, and protection of the rights of others, but we commit to Processing Personal Data only to the extent necessary and proportionate to achieve legitimate purposes.</p>
            <p>WebIntel further acknowledges Section 39 of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression and the press, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference. The Platform facilitates the exercise of this freedom by enabling users to access and analyze publicly available information about websites, while respecting the privacy rights of individuals and the intellectual property rights of third parties.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023</h3>
            <p>WebIntel operates in full compliance with the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 (hereinafter “NDPA”), which establishes the comprehensive legal framework for data protection in Nigeria. The NDPA enshrines fundamental principles of data protection that guide all of our Processing activities. These principles include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:</strong> Personal Data shall be Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the Data Subject. WebIntel ensures that all Processing has a valid legal basis, that Processing is conducted in a manner that is fair to Data Subjects, and that Data Subjects are provided with clear and accessible information about how their Personal Data is Processed.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> Personal Data shall be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further Processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. WebIntel collects Personal Data only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and does not use such data for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes for which it was originally collected.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Personal Data shall be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is Processed. WebIntel has designed the Platform to minimize the collection of Personal Data, collecting only such information as is necessary to provide the Service and fulfill our legal obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Personal Data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step shall be taken to ensure that Personal Data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is Processed, is erased or rectified without delay. WebIntel provides mechanisms for users to update their Account information and correct inaccuracies.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Limitation:</strong> Personal Data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data is Processed. WebIntel implements data retention policies that ensure Personal Data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity and Confidentiality:</strong> Personal Data shall be Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the Personal Data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures. WebIntel implements robust security measures as described in Article VII hereof.</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> The Controller shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with the principles set forth above. WebIntel maintains comprehensive records of our Processing activities and implements policies, procedures, and technical measures to ensure and demonstrate compliance with data protection principles.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.3 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
            <p>Where WebIntel Processes Personal Data of individuals located in the European Union or European Economic Area, or where the GDPR otherwise applies by virtue of its territorial scope provisions, WebIntel ensures full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter “GDPR”). The GDPR establishes stringent requirements for the Processing of Personal Data and grants extensive rights to Data Subjects, all of which WebIntel respects and implements.</p>
            <p>WebIntel acknowledges that the GDPR principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality; and accountability are substantially similar to those set forth in the NDPA, and our compliance measures are designed to satisfy both frameworks simultaneously. Where the GDPR imposes more stringent requirements than the NDPA, we apply such higher standards to ensure full compliance.</p>
            <p>For users located in the European Union or European Economic Area, WebIntel provides all rights guaranteed under the GDPR, including the right of access, right to rectification, right to erasure, right to restriction of processing, right to data portability, right to object, and rights related to automated decision-making and profiling. These rights are described in detail in Article VIII hereof.</p>
            <h3>2.4 International Human Rights Instruments</h3>
            <p>WebIntel recognizes and commits to upholding the principles set forth in international human rights instruments concerning privacy and data protection, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</strong>, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, which provides in Article 12 that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation, and that everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.</li>
              <li><strong>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)</strong>, to which Nigeria is a State Party, which provides in Article 17 that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation, and that everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.</li>
              <li><strong>The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights</strong>, to which Nigeria is a State Party, which provides in Article 5 that every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being and to the recognition of his legal status, and prohibits all forms of exploitation and degradation of man, which we interpret as encompassing protection against exploitation of personal information.</li>
              <li><strong>The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</strong>, which establish that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights, meaning they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved. WebIntel conducts human rights due diligence in relation to our data processing activities and seeks to address any adverse impacts on the privacy rights of individuals.</li>
            </ul>

        title: "ARTICLE III: INFORMATION WE COLLECT",
        content: `
            <h3>3.1 Overview of Data Collection Practices</h3>
            <p>WebIntel has designed the Platform with a privacy-first architecture that fundamentally minimizes the collection and processing of Personal Data. Unlike many web-based services that collect extensive user data and store such data on centralized servers, the Platform employs a decentralized approach in which most user-generated data is stored exclusively in the user’s browser Local Storage and never transmitted to or stored on WebIntel’s servers.</p>
            <p>This section describes the limited categories of Personal Data that we do collect, the purposes for which we collect such data, and the legal bases for such collection. It is important to note that the Platform’s core functionality does not require extensive personal information, and users can derive substantial value from the Service with minimal disclosure of Personal Data.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Account Registration and Authentication Data</h3>
            <p>When you create an Account to access certain features of the Platform, we collect and process the following Personal Data through the Firebase Authentication service:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> We collect your email address as the primary identifier for your Account. This email address is used to authenticate your identity when you log into the Platform, to communicate important information about your Account or the Service, and to facilitate account recovery in the event that you forget your password. The email address is stored securely by Firebase Authentication services and is subject to Firebase’s security and privacy practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Password:</strong> When you create an Account, you must establish a password. The password is encrypted using industry-standard cryptographic techniques and is never stored or transmitted in plain text. We do not have access to your actual password; we can only verify that the password you enter during authentication matches the encrypted password stored in the Firebase Authentication system.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> When you successfully authenticate to the Platform, Firebase Authentication generates session tokens that are used to maintain your authenticated session. These tokens are stored in your browser and are transmitted to Firebase servers to verify your authentication status. The tokens are cryptographically signed and have limited validity periods to enhance security.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Creation Timestamp:</strong> We record the date and time when your Account was created. This information is used for account management purposes and to analyze platform usage patterns in aggregate.</li>
                <li><strong>Last Login Timestamp:</strong> We record the date and time of your most recent login to the Platform. This information is used for account security purposes, to identify inactive accounts, and to provide you with information about your account activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Device and Browser Information:</strong> For security purposes, Firebase Authentication may collect information about the device and browser you use to access the Platform, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, operating system, device identifiers, and similar technical information. This information is used to detect and prevent fraudulent authentication attempts, to identify suspicious login patterns, and to provide you with security alerts concerning unauthorized access to you’re account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The legal basis for processing this authentication data is contractual necessity, as the processing is necessary to create and maintain your Account and to provide you with authenticated access to certain features of the Platform. Additionally, the processing of device and browser information for security purposes is based on our legitimate interest in protecting the security and integrity of the Platform and preventing fraud and unauthorized access.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Analysis Request Data</h3>
            <p>When you utilize the Platform’s website analysis features, you input the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website you wish to analyze. This URL is transmitted to various third-party services to generate the analysis report. It is important to note that the URL you submit for analysis does not constitute your Personal Data, as it identifies a third-party website rather than you as an individual. However, we recognize that your selection of particular websites for analysis could potentially reveal information about your interests, business activities, or research focus.</p>
            <p>The Platform's architecture is designed such that we do not maintain server-side logs of the specific URLs you analyze. When you submit a URL for analysis, the following data flows occur:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transmission to Google PageSpeed Insights:</strong> The URL is transmitted directly from your browser to Google’s PageSpeed Insights Application Programming Interface (API) to obtain performance metrics, Core Web Vitals data, and Lighthouse audit results. This transmission occurs directly between your browser and Google’s servers, and WebIntel does not store or log the URL on our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Transmission to Google Gemini:</strong> Website metadata and technical characteristics derived from the target website are transmitted to Google Gemini artificial intelligence services to generate AI-enhanced insights, recommendations, and technology stack identifications. These transmissions contain information about the target website but do not contain Personal Data identifying you as the user requesting the analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Transmission to IP Geolocation Services:</strong> The Internet Protocol address of the target website being analyzed may be transmitted to ip-api.com or similar geolocation services to obtain information about the hosting provider, geographic location, and autonomous system of the server hosting the target website. This transmission involves the IP address of the target website, not your IP address.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage of Analysis Results:</strong> The results of the analysis, including all reports, metrics, and AI-generated insights, are stored exclusively in your browser’s Local Storage mechanism. These analysis results remain on your device and are not transmitted to or stored on WebIntel’s servers. You have complete control over this locally stored data and can delete it at any time through the Platform’s history management interface or through your browser’s data management tools.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because analysis URLs and results are not stored on our servers and because we do not maintain logs of user analysis activities, we cannot provide you with historical analysis data if you clear your browser’s Local Storage or access the Platform from a different device or browser. This architecture is intentional and is designed to maximize your privacy and control over your data.</p>
            <h3>3.4 Communication Data</h3>
            <p>If you communicate with us through email, contact forms, support systems, or other communication channels, we collect and retain the content of such communications, your email address or other contact information, and any other information you choose to provide. This information is collected and processed for the purposes of responding to your inquiries, providing customer support, addressing technical issues, and improving the Service based on user feedback.</p>
            <p>The legal basis for processing communication data is our legitimate interest in providing responsive customer support, addressing user inquiries, and improving the Service. In some cases, the processing may also be necessary for the performance of our contract with you or for compliance with legal obligations, such as requirements to retain records of customer complaints.</p>
            <p>Communications may be retained for a reasonable period necessary to address your inquiry and for record-keeping purposes, after which they are securely deleted in accordance with our data retention policies described in Article VI hereof.</p>
            <h3>3.5 Technical and Usage Data</h3>
            <p>In the course of operating the Platform, our servers and systems automatically collect certain technical information about your access to and use of the Service. This information is collected primarily for the purposes of maintaining the security and integrity of the Platform, diagnosing technical problems, analyzing usage patterns in aggregate to improve the Service, and detecting and preventing fraud and abuse. The technical and usage data we collect includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Server Access Logs:</strong> Our web servers automatically record certain information when you access the Platform, including your IP address, the date and time of access, the pages or resources requested, the HTTP status code returned, the amount of data transferred, the referring URL (if any), and your browser user agent string. These server logs are necessary for the operation and security of the Platform and are retained for a limited period for security and diagnostic purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> When technical errors occur during your use of the Platform, our systems automatically log information about the error, including error messages, stack traces, the state of the application at the time of the error, and information about the user action that triggered the error. This information is used to diagnose and resolve technical issues and to improve the stability and reliability of the Platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Monitoring Data:</strong> We collect aggregate performance metrics concerning the Platform’s operation, including page load times, API response times, error rates, and system resource utilization. This information is collected in aggregate form and is used to monitor the health and performance of the Platform and to identify areas for optimization.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Monitoring Data:</strong> For security purposes, we monitor access patterns, authentication attempts, and other activities that may indicate security threats, fraudulent activity, or abuse of the Platform. This may include monitoring for unusual access patterns, repeated failed authentication attempts, attempts to access unauthorized resources, and other indicators of potential security incidents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The legal basis for processing technical and usage data is our legitimate interest in maintaining the security, stability, and performance of the Platform, detecting and preventing fraud and abuse, and improving the Service. In some cases, the processing may also be necessary for compliance with legal obligations, such as requirements to maintain security logs or to cooperate with law enforcement investigations.</p>
            <p>We implement measures to minimize the retention of IP addresses and other identifiers in logs, and we do not use technical data to track individual users across sessions or to build user profiles for marketing or other purposes unrelated to the operation and security of the Platform.</p>
            <h3>3.6 Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies</h3>
            <p>The Platform uses cookies and similar tracking technologies for limited purposes related to the functionality, security, and performance of the Service. Our use of cookies is described in detail in Article V hereof. The cookies we use are primarily functional cookies necessary for authentication and session management, and we do not use cookies for advertising, marketing, or cross-site tracking purposes.</p>
            <h3>3.7 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
            <p>It is important to note the categories of information that we deliberately do not collect, in furtherance of our privacy-first approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Website Analysis History:</strong> We do not maintain server-side records of the specific websites you have analyzed using the Platform. This information is stored exclusively in your browser’s Local Storage and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparison Data:</strong> Data concerning website comparisons you conduct using the Platform’s side-by-side comparison feature is stored exclusively in your browser’s Local Storage and is not transmitted to or stored on our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>User Preferences and Settings:</strong> Configuration preferences and settings you establish within the Platform are stored in your browser’s Local Storage and are not transmitted to our servers, with the exception of essential account settings required for authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> The Platform is currently offered without charge, and we do not collect payment card information, billing addresses, or other financial information. Should we introduce paid features in the future, any payment processing would be handled by third-party payment processors, and we would not directly collect or store payment card information.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensitive Personal Data:</strong> We do not knowingly collect or process special categories of Personal Data (also known as sensitive personal data), including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. We design the Platform to avoid the collection of such data, and we request that users not provide such information to us.</li>
            </ul>

        title: "ARTICLE VI: DATA RETENTION AND DELETION",
        content: `
            <h3>6.1 General Retention Principles</h3>
            <p>WebIntel is committed to retaining Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. We implement data retention policies and procedures designed to ensure that Personal Data is deleted or anonymized when it is no longer needed for legitimate purposes.</p>
            <p>Our retention periods are determined based on the nature of the data, the purposes for which it is processed, applicable legal requirements, and the risks associated with continued retention. We periodically review our data holdings to identify and delete or anonymize data that has exceeded its retention period.</p>
            <h3>6.2 Retention of Authentication Data</h3>
            <p>Personal Data associated with your Account, including your email address, encrypted password, account creation timestamp, and authentication logs, is retained for the duration of your Account’s active status and for a limited period thereafter. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active Accounts:</strong> While your Account remains active, your authentication data is retained in the Firebase Authentication system to enable you to access your Account and use authenticated features of the Platform. Your email address and encrypted password are retained indefinitely while your Account remains active, as they are necessary for authentication purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you delete your Account through the Platform’s account management interface or by contacting us to request deletion, your authentication data will be deleted from the Firebase Authentication system within thirty days of the deletion request, subject to the retention requirements described below. During this thirty-day grace period, you may be able to recover your Account by contacting us, after which your authentication data will be permanently deleted.</li>
                <li><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> Accounts that remain inactive for an extended period, currently defined as twenty-four months without any login activity, may be subject to deletion. Before deleting an inactive Account, we will attempt to notify you at the email address associated with your Account to provide you with an opportunity to retain your Account by logging in. If we are unable to contact you or if you do not respond within the specified timeframe, your Account and associated authentication data may be deleted.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Security Retention:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, we may retain certain authentication data for longer periods where necessary to comply with legal obligations, such as requirements to retain records for tax, accounting, or regulatory purposes, to resolve disputes, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, or to maintain security logs for fraud prevention and investigation purposes. Such data will be retained only for as long as necessary for these specific purposes and will be securely deleted thereafter.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6.3 Retention of Locally Stored Data</h3>
            <p>Analysis history, comparison data, preferences, and other information stored in your browser’s Local Storage is not subject to retention periods established by WebIntel because this data is stored exclusively on your device and is not transmitted to or controlled by our servers. This locally stored data persists on your device until you take one of the following actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You manually delete the data through the Platform’s history management interface, which provides functionality to delete individual analysis results or to clear all stored history.</li>
                <li>You manually clear your browser’s Local Storage or site data through your browser’s privacy or data management settings.</li>
                <li>You uninstall the browser or delete the browser profile in which the data is stored.</li>
                <li>Your browser automatically deletes Local Storage data pursuant to the browser’s data retention policies, which vary depending on the browser and may depend on available storage space and other factors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have no control over the retention or deletion of locally stored data once it is stored on your device, and we cannot retrieve or delete this data on your behalf. You are solely responsible for managing locally stored data, and we strongly recommend that you periodically review and delete any stored analysis history that you no longer need.</p>
            <h3>6.4 Retention of Communication Data</h3>
            <p>Communications between you and WebIntel, including emails, support tickets, feedback submissions, and other correspondence, are retained for a period necessary to address your inquiry, resolve any issues raised, and maintain a record of our interactions for customer service quality assurance purposes. Generally, communication data is retained for a period of twenty-four months from the date of the last communication in a particular thread or support case, after which it is securely deleted.</p>
            <p>In certain circumstances, we may retain communication data for longer periods where necessary to comply with legal obligations, to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims, or where the communication relates to ongoing issues or investigations that require extended retention.</p>
            <h3>6.5 Retention of Technical and Usage Data</h3>
            <p>Server access logs, error logs, security logs, and other technical data are retained for limited periods necessary to maintain platform security, diagnose technical issues, and monitor performance. Our retention periods for technical data are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard Access Logs:</strong> Server access logs containing IP addresses and basic request information are retained for a period of ninety days, after which they are automatically deleted. These logs are retained to allow for security monitoring, abuse detection, and technical troubleshooting within a reasonable timeframe after access occurs.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Logs:</strong> Logs of authentication attempts, security events, and potential security incidents may be retained for longer periods, up to twelve months, to enable comprehensive security analysis, fraud investigation, and compliance with legal requirements to maintain security records.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> Technical error logs are retained for a period of six months to allow for diagnosis and resolution of recurring technical issues. After this period, error logs are deleted unless they are relevant to ongoing investigations or bug resolution efforts.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregate Analytics Data:</strong> Aggregate, anonymized data concerning platform usage, performance metrics, and user behavior patterns may be retained indefinitely because such data does not identify individual users and is not considered Personal Data under applicable data protection legislation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>6.6 Legal Holds and Preservation Requirements</h3>
            <p>Notwithstanding the retention periods described above, we may be required to retain Personal Data for longer periods in certain circumstances, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legal Proceedings:</strong> If Personal Data is relevant to actual or reasonably anticipated legal proceedings, litigation, arbitration, investigation, or regulatory inquiry, we may place a legal hold on such data to preserve it until the matter is resolved and all appeals are exhausted. During the period of a legal hold, normal retention periods and deletion schedules are suspended for the affected data.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Requirements:</strong> Certain regulatory frameworks may require retention of specific categories of data for defined periods. Where such requirements apply, we will retain the affected data in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Law Enforcement Requests:</strong> If we receive a valid legal process, such as a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or formal law enforcement request, requiring preservation or production of Personal Data, we will preserve such data as required by the legal process and as advised by legal counsel.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When Personal Data is subject to a legal hold or preservation requirement, we implement appropriate measures to ensure the data is securely preserved in an unaltered state and to prevent its inadvertent deletion or modification.</p>
            <h3>6.7 Secure Data Deletion Procedures</h3>
            <p>When Personal Data reaches the end of its retention period and is eligible for deletion, we employ secure deletion methods designed to prevent unauthorized recovery or reconstruction of the deleted data. Our deletion procedures include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Database Record Deletion:</strong> Personal Data stored in databases is deleted by overwriting the relevant database records and purging the data from database backups that have exceeded their retention periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Log File Deletion:</strong> Log files containing Personal Data are securely deleted by overwriting the files and ensuring they are removed from backup systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Data Deletion:</strong> For Personal Data processed by third-party service providers acting as Processors, such as Firebase Authentication, we issue deletion instructions to such Processors and verify that the data has been deleted in accordance with our instructions and the Processor’s data retention policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup Deletion:</strong> Personal Data stored in backups is automatically deleted when the backups themselves reach the end of their retention period and are rotated out of our backup systems. We maintain backups for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes, with backup retention periods typically ranging from thirty to ninety days.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Following secure deletion, Personal Data cannot be recovered through normal system operations. However, residual copies may persist in backup systems for limited periods until such backups are themselves deleted or overwritten in the normal course of backup rotation.</p>

        title: "ARTICLE VII: DATA SECURITY MEASURES",
        content: `
            <h3>7.1 Commitment to Data Security</h3>
            <p>WebIntel is deeply committed to protecting the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Personal Data entrusted to us by our users. We recognize that appropriate data security is both a legal obligation under the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023, the General Data Protection Regulation, and other applicable data protection legislation, and a fundamental component of maintaining user trust and confidence in the Platform.</p>
            <p>We implement comprehensive technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. These measures take into account the state of the art in information security, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, and the varying risks of likelihood and severity to the rights and freedoms of individuals.</p>
            <p>While we employ robust security measures, we acknowledge that no method of transmission over the internet and no method of electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of Personal Data, and users access and use the Platform at their own risk. However, we continually review and enhance our security practices to maintain a high level of protection against evolving threats.</p>
            <h3>7.2 Technical Security Measures</h3>
            <p>We implement the following technical security measures to protect Personal Data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using Transport Layer Security protocol version 1.2 or higher. This encryption protects against eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks during transmission. We enforce HTTPS for all connections to the Platform and implement HTTP Strict Transport Security headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Sensitive Personal Data stored in our systems and in third-party systems such as Firebase Authentication is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Authentication credentials are encrypted using secure cryptographic hash functions with appropriate salting to prevent credential theft even in the event of a database breach.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We implement role-based access controls and the principle of least privilege to ensure that access to systems containing Personal Data is restricted to authorized personnel who require such access to perform their job functions. Access rights are regularly reviewed and revoked when no longer necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Access to administrative systems and data repositories requires multi-factor authentication. We implement strong password policies requiring complex passwords and regular password changes for accounts with access to sensitive systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Our infrastructure is protected by firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and intrusion prevention systems designed to detect and block unauthorized access attempts, malicious traffic, and known attack patterns. We implement network segmentation to isolate sensitive systems from less critical systems and from the public internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Development Practices:</strong> We follow secure software development lifecycle practices, including security requirements analysis, threat modeling, secure coding standards, code review processes, and security testing. We regularly scan our codebase for known vulnerabilities and apply security patches promptly.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong> We conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify potential security weaknesses in the Platform. Identified vulnerabilities are prioritized based on risk and remediated according to established timelines, with critical vulnerabilities receiving immediate attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Monitoring:</strong> We implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of security-relevant events, including authentication attempts, access to sensitive data, system changes, and potential security incidents. Security logs are regularly reviewed and analyzed to detect anomalous patterns that may indicate security threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> We maintain regular backups of critical systems and data to enable recovery in the event of data loss, system failure, or disaster. Backups are encrypted, stored securely, and tested regularly to ensure recoverability. Our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are designed to minimize service disruption and data loss in the event of major incidents.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>7.3 Organizational Security Measures</h3>
            <p>In addition to technical security controls, we implement organizational measures to ensure appropriate data security:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security Policies and Procedures:</strong> We maintain comprehensive information security policies, data protection policies, incident response procedures, and other documentation establishing security requirements and responsibilities throughout the organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Training and Awareness:</strong> All personnel with access to Personal Data receive training concerning data protection principles, security best practices, and their responsibilities under applicable data protection legislation. We conduct regular security awareness training to ensure personnel remain informed of evolving threats and appropriate protective measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality Obligations:</strong> All employees, contractors, and other personnel with access to Personal Data are bound by contractual confidentiality obligations prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data and requiring compliance with our security policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Vendor Management:</strong> We conduct due diligence on third-party service providers that process Personal Data on our behalf to ensure they implement appropriate security measures. We enter into data processing agreements with such providers establishing their security obligations, audit rights, and liability for security breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Systems containing Personal Data are hosted in secure data centers that implement physical access controls, environmental controls, and monitoring systems to prevent unauthorized physical access.</li>
                <li><strong>Change Management:</strong> We implement formal change management procedures requiring security review and approval of changes to systems that process Personal Data before such changes are deployed to production environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> We maintain an incident response plan establishing procedures for detecting, responding to, containing, and recovering from security incidents. The plan assigns responsibilities, defines escalation procedures, and establishes communication protocols for notifying affected parties in the event of a data breach.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>7.4 Third-Party Security</h3>
            <p>Personal Data processed by third-party service providers, particularly Firebase Authentication services operated by Google, is subject to the security measures implemented by such providers. We select third-party providers based in part on their security capabilities and certifications, and we require contractual commitments concerning data security from such providers.</p>
            <p>Google implements extensive security measures to protect data processed through Firebase Authentication, including encryption, access controls, security monitoring, and compliance with various security standards and certifications. Information concerning Google’s security practices is available in Google’s security and compliance documentation.</p>
            <p>While we conduct due diligence on third-party providers and require appropriate contractual protections, we cannot guarantee the security practices of third parties, and we are not responsible for security breaches or incidents occurring within third-party systems, except to the extent we failed to conduct appropriate due diligence or to include appropriate contractual protections.</p>
            <h3>7.5 Data Breach Response and Notification</h3>
            <p>In the event of a data breach that results in unauthorized access to, disclosure of, loss of, or alteration of Personal Data, we will respond promptly and appropriately to contain the breach, assess its impact, and notify affected parties as required by law. Our data breach response procedures include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detection and Assessment:</strong> Upon becoming aware of a potential data breach, we immediately initiate an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident, what Personal Data was affected, how many individuals are impacted, and what the likely consequences are for affected individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Containment and Remediation:</strong> We take immediate steps to contain the breach, prevent further unauthorized access or disclosure, and remediate the vulnerabilities that allowed the breach to occur.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification to Authorities:</strong> If required by applicable data protection legislation, we notify the relevant supervisory authority of the breach without undue delay and, where feasible, within seventy-two hours of becoming aware of the breach. The notification includes details of the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of affected individuals and data records, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification to Affected Individuals:</strong> If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of affected individuals, we notify such individuals without undue delay. The notification describes the nature of the breach, provides contact information for obtaining more information, describes the likely consequences, and explains the measures taken or proposed to address the breach and mitigate its effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> We document all data breaches, including the facts surrounding the breach, its effects, and the remedial actions taken. This documentation is maintained for compliance purposes and to enable demonstration of our compliance with data breach notification obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>7.6 User Security Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>While we implement comprehensive security measures to protect Personal Data, users also have important security responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account credentials, including your password. You should use a strong, unique password that is not used for other services, and you should not share your password with anyone. You should immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> Because analysis history and other data is stored in your browser’s Local Storage, the security of this data depends on the security of your device. You should implement appropriate security measures on your devices, including using strong passwords or biometric authentication, keeping your operating system and software up to date with security patches, and using reputable antivirus and anti-malware software.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Communications:</strong> When communicating with us by email or other means, be aware that such communications may not be secure. You should not include sensitive Personal Data, such as passwords or financial information, in unencrypted email communications.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing Awareness:</strong> Be vigilant against phishing attempts that impersonate WebIntel or request your Account credentials. We will never ask you to provide your password in an email or other unsolicited communication. If you receive suspicious communications purporting to be from WebIntel, do not click on links or provide any information, and report the communication to us immediately.</li>

        title: "ARTICLE VIII: YOUR RIGHTS UNDER DATA PROTECTION LAW",
        content: `
            <h3>8.1 Overview of Data Subject Rights</h3>
            <p>Under the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023, the General Data Protection Regulation where applicable, and other data protection legislation, you have certain rights concerning your Personal Data. These rights empower you to understand and control how your Personal Data is processed, to ensure the accuracy of your Personal Data, and to object to or restrict certain processing activities. WebIntel is committed to facilitating the exercise of these rights and to responding promptly to requests from individuals seeking to exercise their rights.</p>
            <p>This Article describes each of your rights, explains how to exercise them, and sets forth any limitations or exceptions that may apply. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided in Article XI hereof. We will respond to your request within the timeframes required by applicable law, generally within one month of receiving your request, although this period may be extended by an additional two months where necessary due to the complexity of the request or the number of requests we are processing.</p>
            <h3>8.2 Right of Access</h3>
            <p>You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not Personal Data concerning you is being processed, and where such data is being processed, to access that Personal Data along with certain information about the processing. This right, commonly referred to as the right of access or the right to know, enables you to understand what Personal Data we hold about you and how we are using it.</p>
            <p>When you exercise your right of access, we will provide you with the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The purposes of the processing, including the specific uses to which your Personal Data is put.</li>
                <li>The categories of Personal Data being processed, such as authentication data, communication data, or technical data.</li>
                <li>The recipients or categories of recipients to whom your Personal Data has been or will be disclosed, particularly recipients in third countries or international organizations.</li>
                <li>Where possible, the envisaged period for which your Personal Data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.</li>
                <li>The existence of your other rights under data protection law, including the right to request rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing, and the right to object to processing.</li>
                <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, such as the Nigeria Data Protection Commission.</li>
                <li>Where Personal Data is collected from sources other than you, information about those sources.</li>
                <li>The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved and the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing.</li>
                <li>Where Personal Data is transferred to a third country or international organization, information about the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will provide you with a copy of the Personal Data undergoing processing. For additional copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where you make your request by electronic means, the information will be provided in a commonly used electronic format unless you request otherwise.</p>
            <h3>8.3 Right to Rectification</h3>
            <p>You have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data concerning you without undue delay. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you also have the right to have incomplete Personal Data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</p>
            <p>If you identify any inaccuracies in your Personal Data or believe that your Personal Data is incomplete, you may request that we correct or complete it. Common scenarios in which you might exercise this right include correcting a misspelled name, updating an outdated email address, or providing additional information that you believe is relevant to the processing purposes.</p>
            <p>Upon receiving a request for rectification, we will assess whether the Personal Data is indeed inaccurate or incomplete and will make appropriate corrections without undue delay. If we are unable to verify the accuracy of your request or if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the Personal Data is accurate as recorded, we will explain our reasoning and inform you of your right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
            <p>Where we have disclosed the Personal Data in question to third parties, we will communicate the rectification to each recipient to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will inform you about those recipients if you request this information.</p>
            <h3>8.4 Right to Erasure</h3>
            <p>You have the right to obtain from us the erasure of Personal Data concerning you without undue delay in certain circumstances. This right, sometimes referred to as the “right to be forgotten,” enables you to request deletion of your Personal Data where continued retention is no longer justified. The right to erasure applies where one of the following grounds exists:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed. For example, if you delete your Account and the authentication data is no longer needed to provide the Service to you, you may request erasure of that data.</li>
                <li>You withdraw consent on which the processing is based, and there is no other legal ground for the processing. If processing was based on your consent and you withdraw that consent, you may request erasure unless we can demonstrate another legal basis for continued processing.</li>
                <li>You object to processing based on legitimate interests, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing. If you object to processing as described in Section 8.7 below and we cannot demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, you may request erasure.</li>
                <li>The Personal Data has been unlawfully processed, meaning it was processed in violation of applicable data protection legislation.</li>
                <li>The Personal Data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation under Nigerian law or European Union law to which we are subject.</li>
                <li>The Personal Data has been collected in relation to the offer of information society services to a child, and there is no legal basis permitting continued retention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the right to erasure is not absolute, and there are circumstances in which we may refuse a request for erasure. These circumstances include where processing is necessary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For exercising the right of freedom of expression and information.</li>
                <li>For compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing under Nigerian law or European Union law to which we are subject, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</li>
                <li>For reasons of public interest in the area of public health.</li>
                <li>For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, insofar as erasure is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such purposes.</li>
                <li>For the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where a request for erasure is refused based on one of these exceptions, we will explain the specific exception that applies and inform you of your right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to seek judicial remedy.</p>
            <h3>8.5 Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to obtain from us restriction of processing in certain circumstances. Restriction of processing means that Personal Data is marked in such a way that its processing is limited for the future. When processing is restricted, we may store the Personal Data but may not otherwise process it except with your consent, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another person, or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
            <p>The right to restriction of processing applies in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy Dispute:</strong> You contest the accuracy of the Personal Data, in which case processing shall be restricted for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the Personal ”ata.</li>
                <li><strong>Unlawful Processing:</strong> The processing is unlawful, but you oppose erasure and request restriction of use instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention Beyond Purpose:</strong> We no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of processing, but you require the data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
                <li><strong>Objection Pending:</strong> You have objected to processing based on legitimate interests, and restriction is requested pending verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your interests, rights, and freedoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where processing has been restricted, we will inform you before the restriction is lifted. Additionally, where we have disclosed the Personal Data to third parties, we will communicate the restriction to each recipient unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort, and we will inform you about those recipients if you request this information.</p>
            <h3>8.6 Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to receive Personal Data concerning you which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that data to another controller without hindrance from us, where the processing is based on consent or on a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
            <p>The right to data portability enables you to move, copy, or transfer Personal Data easily from one information technology environment to another in a safe and secure manner, without affecting its usability. This right facilitates switching between service providers and promotes competition in the digital marketplace.</p>
            <p>When exercising the right to data portability, you may request that we transmit the Personal Data directly to another controller where technically feasible. The data portability right applies only to Personal Data that you have provided to us, not to data we have derived or inferred from your use of the Service.</p>
            <p>In the context of the Platform, the right to data portability has limited application because most user-generated data, including analysis history and preferences, is stored exclusively In your browser's Local Storage and is already under your direct control. You can export this data at any time through the Platform’s history management interface or through your browser’s data management tools. The primary Personal Data that we control is authentication data stored in Firebase Authentication, and we will provide this data to you in a portable format upon request.</p>
            <h3>8.7 Right to Object</h3>
            <p>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing of Personal Data concerning you which is based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task carried out in the public interest. If you exercise this right, we shall no longer process your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
            <p>Where Personal Data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to such processing at any time, without needing to provide any justification. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, we shall no longer process your Personal Data for such purposes. However, as noted in Article IV hereof, we do not currently use Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, so this aspect of the right to object has limited practical application in the context of the Platform.</p>
            <p>In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you may exercise your right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>
            <h3>8.8 Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h3>
            <p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This right applies unless the automated decision-making is necessary for entering into or performing a contract between you and us, is authorized by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</p>
            <p>As noted in Section 4.2 hereof, the Platform does not employ automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. Therefore, this right has limited application in the context of your use of the Platform. Should we introduce any such automated decision-making processes in the future, we will provide you with meaningful information about the logic involved, the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for you, and appropriate safeguards to protect your rights and freedoms.</p>
            <h3>8.9 Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
            <p>Where processing is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. You will be informed of your right to withdraw consent prior to giving consent, and it must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.</p>
            <p>In the context of the Platform, the primary processing activities based on consent are your acceptance of cookies and your agreement to the processing practices described in this Privacy Policy. You can withdraw consent to non-essential cookies at any time through your browser settings or through any cookie preference interface we provide. You can withdraw consent to processing by ceasing to use the Platform and deleting your Account.</p>
            <h3>8.10 Exercising Your Rights</h3>
            <p>To exercise any of the rights described in this Article, please contact us using the contact information provided in Article XI hereof. Your request should clearly identify which right you wish to exercise and should provide sufficient information to enable us to identify you and locate your Personal Data. In some cases, we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity and ensure that Personal Data is disclosed only to the individual to whom it relates.</p>
            <p>We do not charge a fee for processing requests to exercise your rights under normal circumstances. However, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the action requested, or we may refuse to act on the request. We will inform you of any fees before processing your request.</p>
            <p>We will respond to your request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This period may be extended by two additional months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. We will inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, along with the reasons for the delay.</p>
            <p>If we refuse to take action on your request, we will inform you without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for the refusal and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking judicial remedy.</p>
            <h3>8.11 Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
            <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of Personal Data relating to you violates applicable data protection legislation. You may lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the jurisdiction where you habitually reside, where you work, or where the alleged infringement occurred.</p>
            <p>For individuals in Nigeria, complaints concerning data protection matters may be lodged with the Nigeria Data Protection Commission. Contact information for the Nigeria Data Protection Commission is available on its official website.</p>
            <p>For individuals in the European Union, complaints may be lodged with the supervisory authority of the Member State in which you habitually reside or work, or in which the alleged infringement took place. A list of European Union supervisory authorities and their contact information is available on the website of the European Data Protection Board.</p>
            <p>Lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy you may have under applicable law, including the right to seek judicial review of decisions made by us concerning your Personal Data and the right to seek compensation for damages resulting from violations of data protection legislation.</p>

        title: "ARTICLE IX: INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS",
        content: `
            <h3>9.1 General Principles</h3>
            <p>WebIntel operates the Platform from Nigeria, and Personal Data collected through the Platform is primarily processed in Nigeria and stored on servers located in Nigeria or in jurisdictions where our hosting and service providers operate. However, the Platform integrates with Third-Party Services operated by entities located in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States, where Google LLC, the provider of Firebase Authentication and Google Gemini services, is headquartered.</p>
            <p>When Personal Data is transferred from Nigeria to other jurisdictions, or when Personal Data of individuals in the European Union is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (third countries), we implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that such Personal Data continues to be protected in accordance with applicable data protection legislation and the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3>9.2 Transfers to the United States</h3>
            <p>Personal Data collected through Firebase Authentication is processed by Google LLC in the United States. Google has implemented various mechanisms to ensure appropriate protection for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, including the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, and comprehensive data protection and security measures.</p>
            <p>Information concerning Google’s international data transfer mechanisms and certifications is available in Google’s privacy and compliance documentation. We have conducted due diligence on Google’s data transfer practices and have satisfied ourselves that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect Personal Data transferred to Google’s systems.</p>
            <p>For transfers from Nigeria to the United States, the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 permits international transfers of Personal Data where the recipient jurisdiction has been designated by the Nigeria Data Protection Commission as providing adequate protection, where appropriate safeguards have been implemented, or where specific derogations apply. We ensure compliance with these requirements for all international transfers from Nigeria.</p>
            <h3>9.3 Standard Contractual Clauses</h3>
            <p>Where we engage service providers located in jurisdictions that have not been determined to provide adequate protection for Personal Data, we implement Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or other appropriate contractual safeguards to ensure that Personal Data transferred to such providers is protected in accordance with European Union data protection standards.</p>
            <p>Standard Contractual Clauses are legally binding contracts between data exporters and data importers that impose obligations on both parties to protect Personal Data transferred from the European Union to third countries. These clauses have been approved by the European Commission as providing adequate safeguards for international data transfers.</p>
            <h3>9.4 Additional Safeguards</h3>
            <p>In addition to Standard Contractual Clauses and other transfer mechanisms, we assess whether supplementary measures are necessary to ensure an adequate level of protection for transferred Personal Data, taking into account the circumstances of the transfer and the laws and practices of the destination country. Supplementary measures may include technical measures such as encryption, pseudonymization, or anonymization, contractual measures beyond the Standard Contractual Clauses, or organizational measures to limit access to transferred data.</p>
            <p>We periodically reassess our international data transfer practices to ensure they remain compliant with evolving legal requirements and guidance from supervisory authorities concerning international transfers, particularly in light of developments in European Union law following the Court of Justice of the European Union’s decision in the Schrems II case and subsequent guidance from the European Data Protection Board.</p>
            <h3>9.5 User Consent to International Transfers</h3>
            <p>By using the Platform and providing Personal Data to us, you acknowledge that your Personal Data may be transferred to, processed in, and stored in jurisdictions outside Nigeria, including the United States, and you consent to such transfer, processing, and storage. You understand that the data protection laws of the United States and other jurisdictions to which your Personal Data may be transferred may differ from the data protection laws of Nigeria or your country of residence and may not provide the same level of protection.</p>
            <p>If you do not wish for your Personal Data to be transferred internationally, you should not create an Account or use features of the Platform that require authentication, as such features necessarily involve the processing of authentication data by Firebase Authentication services in the United States. However, you may continue to use the core website analysis functionality of the Platform without creating an Account, in which case your analysis results will be stored exclusively in your browser’s Local Storage and will not be transferred internationally.</p>

        title: "ARTICLE X: CHILDREN’S PRIVACY",
        content: `
            <h3>10.1 Age Restrictions and Prohibitions</h3>
            <p>The Platform is not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, a child is defined as any individual under the age of eighteen years, consistent with the definition of a child under the Child’s Rights Act of Nigeria and international conventions concerning the rights of the child to which Nigeria is a party.</p>
            <p>The Terms and Conditions of the Platform explicitly prohibit use of the Platform by individuals under the age of eighteen years or under the age of majority in their jurisdiction, whichever is greater. By creating an Account or using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you meet these age requirements.</p>
            <h3>10.2 Prohibition on Knowingly Collecting Children’s Data</h3>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Personal Data from children. We do not direct the Platform to children, we do not knowingly allow children to create Accounts, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from individuals we know to be children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from a child without appropriate parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete such information from our systems.</p>
            <p>The prohibition on collecting children’s data reflects both our legal obligations under the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023, which provides heightened protections for children’s Personal Data, and our ethical commitment to protecting the privacy and safety of children online. We recognize that children are particularly vulnerable to privacy risks and that special care must be taken to protect their Personal Data.</p>
            <h3>10.3 Parental Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Parents and legal guardians are responsible for monitoring and supervising their children’s online activities and for ensuring that children do not use services that are not intended for them. If you are a parent or legal guardian and you become aware that your child has provided Personal Data to us without your consent, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided in Article XI hereof.</p>
            <p>Upon receiving notice that we have collected Personal Data from a child without appropriate consent, we will investigate the matter and, if we verify that the user is indeed a child, we will promptly delete all Personal Data associated with that user’s Account. We will also take steps to prevent the child from creating a new Account or otherwise accessing authenticated features of the Platform.</p>
            <p>Parents and legal guardians have the right to review Personal Data collected from their children, to request deletion of such data, and to refuse to permit further collection or use of their children’s Personal Data. We will comply with all such requests upon verification of parental authority and subject to applicable legal requirements and exceptions.</p>
            <h3>10.4 Verification Procedures</h3>
            <p>While we do not implement age verification mechanisms at the point of Account creation, we reserve the right to request proof of age from any user if we have reason to believe that the user may be a child. If a user is unable or unwilling to provide satisfactory proof that they meet the minimum age requirements, we will suspend or terminate their Account and delete associated Personal Data in accordance with our data retention policies.</p>
            <p>We encourage users, parents, educators, and others who become aware of children using the Platform to report such use to us so that we can take appropriate action. Reports may be submitted using the contact information provided in Article XI hereof and should include sufficient information to enable us to identify the Account in question.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the requirements of the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 and the General Data Protection Regulation where applicable, WebIntel has designated a Data Protection Officer responsible for monitoring our compliance with data protection legislation, providing advice on data protection impact assessments, cooperating with supervisory authorities, and serving as a contact point for data protection matters.</p>
            <p>The Data Protection Officer may be contacted directly concerning data protection matters, including questions about our data processing practices, concerns about compliance with data protection legislation, or complaints regarding the handling of Personal Data. Contact information for the Data Protection Officer is published on the Platform’s website and may also be obtained by contacting our general privacy contact address.</p>
            <p>The Data Protection Officer operates independently in performing data protection functions and reports directly to the highest level of management. The Data Protection Officer is not dismissed or penalized for performing data protection duties and has appropriate resources and access to Personal Data and processing operations to fulfill data protection responsibilities effectively.</p>
            <h3>11.3 Supervisory Authority Contact Information</h3>
            <p>If you believe that our processing of your Personal Data violates applicable data protection legislation, or if you are dissatisfied with our response to your inquiry or request concerning privacy matters, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority as described in Section 8.11 hereof.</p>
            <p>For individuals in Nigeria, complaints may be directed to the Nigeria Data Protection Commission. The Commission is responsible for enforcing the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 and has the authority to investigate complaints, conduct audits, issue enforcement notices, and impose administrative fines for violations of data protection requirements. Current contact information for the Nigeria Data Protection Commission is available”on the Commission’s official website and through official government directories.</p>
            <p>For individuals in the European Union or European Economic Area, complaints may be lodged with the supervisory authority of the Member State in which you habitually reside, where you work, or where the alleged infringement occurred. Each European Union Member State has designated a supervisory authority responsible for enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation within its territory. Contact information for all European Union supervisory authorities is available through the website of the European Data Protection Board.</p>
            <p>Lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority does not preclude you from seeking other remedies available under applicable law, including judicial remedies, and you may pursue both administrative and judicial remedies concurrently or sequentially as you deem appropriate.</p>

We are committed to maintaining transparent and up-to-date privacy practices, and we will update this Privacy Policy as necessary to accurately reflect how we collect, use, and protect Personal Data.</p>
            <p>When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of the Policy to indicate when the most recent changes were made. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to remain informed about how we protect your Personal Data and about any changes to our privacy practices.</p>
            <h3>12.2 Notification of Material Changes</h3>
            <p>If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that significantly affect how we collect, use, disclose, or otherwise process your Personal Data, or that materially affect your rights or obligations with respect to your Personal Data, we will provide you with prominent notice of such changes. The method of notification will depend on the nature and significance of the changes and may include one or more of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Posting a prominent notice on the Platform’s homepage or within the user interface indicating that material changes have been made to the Privacy Policy and encouraging users to review the updated Policy.</li>
                <li>Sending an electronic mail notification to the email address associated with your Account, if you have created an Account, describing the nature of the material changes and providing a link to the updated Privacy Policy.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>12.3 Consent to Material Changes</h3>
            <p>For certain types of material changes that would require your consent under applicable data protection legislation, we will obtain your affirmative consent before implementing such changes with respect to your Personal Data. Such changes might include introducing new purposes for processing that are incompatible with the original purposes, disclosing Personal Data to categories of recipients not previously disclosed, or transferring Personal Data to jurisdictions not previously identified.</p>
            <p>If you do not consent to material changes that require your consent, we will continue to process your Personal Data in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy to which you previously agreed, to the extent legally permissible, or we may be unable to continue providing certain features or functionality of the Platform to you. In some cases, refusal to consent to material changes may result in termination of your Account if continued provision of the Service is not feasible under the prior Privacy Policy terms.</p>
            <h3>12.4 Continued Use as Acceptance</h3>
            <p>Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes, except with respect to material changes that require your affirmative consent as described above.

            <p>It Is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and to remain informed of any changes. We are not obligated to provide individual notice of non-material changes or changes that do not require your consent, and your continued use of the Platform following such changes constitutes acceptance regardless of whether you have actually reviewed the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3>12.5 Archival of Prior Versions</h3>
            <p>We may maintain archival copies of prior versions of this Privacy Policy for record-keeping purposes and to enable users to review the terms that were in effect at particular points in time. Where feasible and appropriate, we may make prior versions of this Privacy Policy available through the Platform’s website or upon request.</p>
            <p>However, the current version of this Privacy Policy, as indicated by the “Last Updated” date, is the version that governs our current practices and your current use of the Platform. Prior versions are maintained solely for historical reference and do not constitute current obligations or commitments except to the extent necessary to demonstrate our compliance with data protection legislation at the time those versions were in effect.</p>
